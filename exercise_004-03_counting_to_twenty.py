''' Paul 11.05.2022 - I wrote it damn wrong - the value in .append() method should be 'square' not 'value' and it's obvious, but got innapropriate indent in print() call!

squares = []
for value in range( 1, 10 ):
	square = value ** 2
	squares.append( value )
	print ( squares )

The output was:

[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

So that was interesting, but got nowhere near what I wanted. Learned to build one side of the pyramid tho. Or stairs, you name it XD '''
