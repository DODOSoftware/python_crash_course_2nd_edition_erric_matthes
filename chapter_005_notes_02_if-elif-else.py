'''NOTE: With added "elif" at the end it is bit clearer to read. With this change
every block of codemust pass a specific test in order to be executed. The "else"
block is matched if any other match with "if" and "elif" is not met. That can 
sometimes include valid or even malicious data, so if you have specific final
condition that you're testing for, consider using "elif" and omit the "else"
block. That give you extra confidence that your code will run only under the
correct conditions.

"if-elif-else" as soon Python finds one test that passes, it skips others.'''
